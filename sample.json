When you switch it on it just flashed rapid orange. On my searches it seams to happen to a lot of people and Gillette will not replace as it is older than 12 mths. Very disappointing and an expensive razor to last a short period of time. If you purchase you should also purchase the protection from Amazon, but Probebly not worth it",

The biggest problem is that the battery doesn\u2019t hold charge at all, fully charge the blade holder and the stand which also hold charge to charge the blade after each use but both batteries fully charged and just let them sit for a week and no charge!!! So beside it\u2019s look and design  it doesn\u2019t really deliver a better warm shaving, at this price it\u2019s unacceptable ( regular ones are much cheaper but you just pay 35%ish more to get the Bugatti,It doesn\u2019t provide a warm smoother experience but if you\u2019re slow it\u2019ll burn your face ( yes it gets a little too hot not warm, quality design look everything excellent, Battery always \ud83e\udeab, even a \ud83d\udd0b fully charged battery will die in a week or so JUST SITTING NOT USE IT, and battery won\u2019t hold charge. Not a good thing when you pay hundreds extra to get a unique shaving experience then you find out it wasn\u2019t what you were expecting.Second appointment",

I was hesitant to try this razor but not at that exorbitant price of $200+! I waited til it came down to $112,(although it\u2019s probably worth no more than $50 tops.) I will say it\u2019s really easy to use, charge, and switch temperatures on the blade.I used it for the first time in my shower, with shave cream, and got a really nice, smooth shave with zero irritation. The warm blade felt nice against the skin. Now, I\u2019ve read plenty of comments of \u201cwhy not just run your razor under hot water instead?\u201d Go ahead, and you\u2019ll have to do that over and over again! It\u2019s not going to continuously give the same feeling as the heated bar below the razor.Now, am I looking forward to paying a premium for replacement blades, no. Here\u2019s the thing though, I can stretch the life span out because I have different razors, and a few electric ones. I like to switch it up from time to time lol!Bottom line is it\u2019s not as bad as all the whiny reviews I\u2019ve read, but it\u2019s not for everyone either. It would be better priced around $50, but so far I do like it. You be the judge.Update: I\u2019m one month into using this razor now, 6 or 7 shaves all in the shower. Before I had to thoroughly wet my face with hot water to keep from the razor tugging my hair as I shave, but not with this razor. As soon as I apply shave cream and turn the heating element on, I\u2019m shaving tug free within 3-4 seconds. The heating element feels nice against the skin, and I really do get a nice, smooth shave. The top blue strip on the razor blade is starting to wear away some, but I\u2019m still getting a good shave from the initial blade.Will update again if things change.UPDATE 2:Razor handle quit charging on 4-18, not even 6 months into using it.I contacted Gillette via the chat feature on their webpage, had to provide proof of purchase through Amazon, and a few days later received a new kit in the mail.The short life of the charging handle does worry me some, but at least Gillette stood behind their product, and gave me a hassle free replacement.Will update again if need be.",

They drop down a little in sharpness but then seem to stay at that level for months so you can either change them every week or two to three times per year.  Now the problem.  I've had 4 of these.  With daily use the battery fails after 13 or 14 months.  Gillette will not offer an exchange or sell you just the razor without the expensive packaging and charger.  They may offer a slight discount but it's the same as their occasional sale price.  This applies to both the Bugatti edition and the regular.  No one appears to have figured out how to open the handle to change the battery.  I have 3 failed units.  I tried heat and solvent to open the first one with no luck.  Next I'm going to try to saw one open.Gillette needs to either fix their charge circuit that is destroying the battery or offer to exchange the razor at some reasonable cost, maybe $45 after the 12 month warranty.",

When I opened the box and looked at the Bugatti, I thought that it would nick my face like crazy. Anyway I lathered up and began shaving. Oh boy!

It's a meticulously engineered shaving experience that leverages thermodynamics to deliver an unparalleled shave. But at a premium price, you can expect the razor to last 2-3 years before needing a total replacement.First Impressions: The Gold Edition oozes luxury. The weighty, gold-trimmed handle feels substantial, while the inductive charging dock screams sophistication. But the true star is the heated blade cartridge. Gillette's micro-heater tech raises the temperature to a precise 122\u00b0F in 0.5 seconds.The Shave: Ah, the shave itself. It's like a warm hug on your face. The heated blade glides effortlessly, prepping hair for the five-blade onslaught. Gone are the days of pre-shave oil\u2014the warmth acts as a lubricant, minimizing friction and irritation. The result? It was a shockingly close shave with minimal razor burn, even on my notoriously sensitive skin.Tech Talk: This razor is a marvel of miniaturization. The lithium-ion battery tucked within the handle powers the heater for up to six shaves while the temperature sensors constantly monitor and adjust heat output for optimal comfort and safety.But it could be better. The hefty price tag might sting, and the proprietary blade cartridges add to the long-term cost. Plus, the temperature range is limited, and some might miss the ritual of a hot shower shave.Verdict: The Gillette Labs Heated Razor Gold Edition is a game-changer. It's not just a razor; it's an investment in a luxurious, comfortable, and technically impressive shaving experience.",

I read about the Gillette Labs razor and heard how good it was, and then stumbled across the heated razor I could get as well.  It was expensive, but I waited and before Black Friday it went on sale with a big price drop.  Even so, it was about six times more expensive than the ordinary Gillette razors.I usually shave in the shower using women's shave oil, which you can find online or in a big box store (the women's oils have many different smells and the bottle is significantly bigger than the oil drops I used to use).  I wait until I have been in there a bit and my face warms up, and then the shave is smooth and easy.  This razor claims to heat your face like they do when you get a barbershop shave, but they say a lot.  I started working out and wanted to shave, but not shower at home until after my workout, which meant shaving with a cold face, and trying to warm up the blade in a sink of hot water.I used this new razor this morning.  It was set to the hottest setting and holy buckets, the shave was amazingly comfortable.  It heats in less than one second and it gets warm.  It really does feel like a hot towel barber shave and I thought I got just as good a shave, if not better because it felt luxurious, than the other Gillette I use in the shower.  It is amazing.  This razor was well worth the money I spent on it.  The only down-side is that I probably wont be able to buy the blade refills at my local big box membership store.  Alas.",

It's like a spa day in your own bathroom! The razor is designed with the same attention to detail as a Bugatti car, and I feel like I'm driving a luxury vehicle on my face.The shave itself is smooth and effortless, thanks to the five blades that effortlessly glide over your skin. The razor even has a FlexDisc technology which adapts to the contours of your face, ensuring a comfortable and close shave every time.The only downside is that my wife keeps trying to steal it for herself! I guess it's not just for men after all.The Bugatti Limited Edition Shave Kit comes with everything you need for the perfect shave, including a magnetic charging dock, a travel case, and even a premium shaving cream. It's the ultimate shaving kit for the man who wants to look and feel his best.Overall, I would highly recommend the Gillette Heated Razor for Men, Bugatti Limited Edition Shave Kit by GilletteLabs to any man (or woman!) who wants to elevate their shaving experience to the next level.

I was hesitant to try this razor but not at that exorbitant price of $200+! I waited til it came down to $112,(although it\u2019s probably worth no more than $50 tops.) I will say it\u2019s really easy to use, charge, and switch temperatures on the blade.I used it for the first time in my shower, with shave cream, and got a really nice, smooth shave with zero irritation. The warm blade felt nice against the skin. Now, I\u2019ve read plenty of comments of \u201cwhy not just run your razor under hot water instead?\u201d Go ahead, and you\u2019ll have to do that over and over again! It\u2019s not going to continuously give the same feeling as the heated bar below the razor.Now, am I looking forward to paying a premium for replacement blades, no. Here\u2019s the thing though, I can stretch the life span out because I have different razors, and a few electric ones. I like to switch it up from time to time lol!Bottom line is it\u2019s not as bad as all the whiny reviews I\u2019ve read, but it\u2019s not for everyone either. It would be better priced around $50, but so far I do like it. You be the judge.Update: I\u2019m one month into using this razor now, 6 or 7 shaves all in the shower. Before I had to thoroughly wet my face with hot water to keep from the razor tugging my hair as I shave, but not with this razor. As soon as I apply shave cream and turn the heating element on, I\u2019m shaving tug free within 3-4 seconds. The heating element feels nice against the skin, and I really do get a nice, smooth shave. The top blue strip on the razor blade is starting to wear away some, but I\u2019m still getting a good shave from the initial blade.Will update again if things change.UPDATE 2:Razor handle quit charging on 4-18, not even 6 months into using it.I contacted Gillette via the chat feature on their webpage, had to provide proof of purchase through Amazon, and a few days later received a new kit in the mail.The short life of the charging handle does worry me some, but at least Gillette stood behind their product, and gave me a hassle free replacement.Will update again if need be.",

With daily use the battery fails after 13 or 14 months.  Gillette will not offer an exchange or sell you just the razor without the expensive packaging and charger.  They may offer a slight discount but it's the same as their occasional sale price.  This applies to both the Bugatti edition and the regular.  No one appears to have figured out how to open the handle to change the battery.  I have 3 failed units.  I tried heat and solvent to open the first one with no luck.  Next I'm going to try to saw one open.Gillette needs to either fix their charge circuit that is destroying the battery or offer to exchange the razor at some reasonable cost, maybe $45 after the 12 month warranty.",

I have a sensitive face and tough beard. I was trying different razors to find one that was good for my face. When I opened the box and looked at the Bugatti, I thought that it would nick my face like crazy. Anyway I lathered up and began shaving. Oh boy!  Was I surprised at how smooth and nick free of a shave I got from it. This is my number one favorite razor to go to.

Much to my disappointment this device had the same problem after 10 months, again within the warranty of the replacement device.Gillette was very kind to again immediately send a replacement. Regrettably, this replacement device\u2019s battery was \u201cdead on arrival\u201d. I was requested to send the defect devices to the Gillette Repair center. Supposedly to verify that the devices were indeed defect. I received again new device in August 2023. But today, December 15 2023, the razor failed again after only 5 months.So that were 4 defect devices in two years. Obviously, Gillette has some serious quality problems. Please don\u2019t buy this product, you will be very disappointed.",

I read about the Gillette Labs razor and heard how good it was, and then stumbled across the heated razor I could get as well.  It was expensive, but I waited and before Black Friday it went on sale with a big price drop.  Even so, it was about six times more expensive than the ordinary Gillette razors.I usually shave in the shower using women's shave oil, which you can find online or in a big box store (the women's oils have many different smells and the bottle is significantly bigger than the oil drops I used to use).  I wait until I have been in there a bit and my face warms up, and then the shave is smooth and easy.  This razor claims to heat your face like they do when you get a barbershop shave, but they say a lot.  I started working out and wanted to shave, but not shower at home until after my workout, which meant shaving with a cold face, and trying to warm up the blade in a sink of hot water.I used this new razor this morning.  It was set to the hottest setting and holy buckets, the shave was amazingly comfortable.  It heats in less than one second and it gets warm.  It really does feel like a hot towel barber shave and I thought I got just as good a shave, if not better because it felt luxurious, than the other Gillette I use in the shower.  It is amazing.  This razor was well worth the money I spent on it.  The only down-side is that I probably wont be able to buy the blade refills at my local big box membership store.  Alas.",

The shave though is good with a new blade replacement however for some reason these blades don't last long as the older 5 blade systems.BTW, replacing/attaching a new blade attachment is difficult to find the correct angle to attach to the handle even though I've tried over several months when required.  Maybe your experience is different.",

To know that it heats up and gives you a warm fuzzy feeling inside is not really justifiable since overall it is really just a regular razor with a heating strip.

It's a meticulously engineered shaving experience that leverages thermodynamics to deliver an unparalleled shave. But at a premium price, you can expect the razor to last 2-3 years before needing a total replacement.First Impressions: The Gold Edition oozes luxury. The weighty, gold-trimmed handle feels substantial, while the inductive charging dock screams sophistication. But the true star is the heated blade cartridge. Gillette's micro-heater tech raises the temperature to a precise 122\u00b0F in 0.5 seconds.The Shave: Ah, the shave itself. It's like a warm hug on your face. The heated blade glides effortlessly, prepping hair for the five-blade onslaught. Gone are the days of pre-shave oil\u2014the warmth acts as a lubricant, minimizing friction and irritation. The result? It was a shockingly close shave with minimal razor burn, even on my notoriously sensitive skin.Tech Talk: This razor is a marvel of miniaturization. The lithium-ion battery tucked within the handle powers the heater for up to six shaves while the temperature sensors constantly monitor and adjust heat output for optimal comfort and safety.But it could be better. The hefty price tag might sting, and the proprietary blade cartridges add to the long-term cost. Plus, the temperature range is limited, and some might miss the ritual of a hot shower shave.Verdict: The Gillette Labs Heated Razor Gold Edition is a game-changer. It's not just a razor; it's an investment in a luxurious, comfortable, and technically impressive shaving experience.",

I read about the Gillette Labs razor and heard how good it was, and then stumbled across the heated razor I could get as well.  It was expensive, but I waited and before Black Friday it went on sale with a big price drop.  Even so, it was about six times more expensive than the ordinary Gillette razors.I usually shave in the shower using women's shave oil, which you can find online or in a big box store (the women's oils have many different smells and the bottle is significantly bigger than the oil drops I used to use).  I wait until I have been in there a bit and my face warms up, and then the shave is smooth and easy.  This razor claims to heat your face like they do when you get a barbershop shave, but they say a lot.  I started working out and wanted to shave, but not shower at home until after my workout, which meant shaving with a cold face, and trying to warm up the blade in a sink of hot water.I used this new razor this morning.  It was set to the hottest setting and holy buckets, the shave was amazingly comfortable.  It heats in less than one second and it gets warm.  It really does feel like a hot towel barber shave and I thought I got just as good a shave, if not better because it felt luxurious, than the other Gillette I use in the shower.  It is amazing.  This razor was well worth the money I spent on it.  The only down-side is that I probably wont be able to buy the blade refills at my local big box membership store.  Alas.",

I have used many razors in my time, actually spending more on certain brands than this one, but I have to tell you, this was the most comfortable, accurate, smooth shave that I have ever had. I was astonished and greatly impressed. The razor cut through my 4 day beard like butter. The absolute closest, comfortable and easiest shave I have ever had. The price may be a little high for some but to get an excellent comfortable shave is worth every penny. Refills are a little pricey but if I can get 10 shaves with each blade, this is a home run for me. I would have liked a little hotter heat strip but that's just me.  THIS IS A WINNER IN MY BOOK !",

When I opened the box and looked at the Bugatti, I thought that it would nick my face like crazy. Anyway I lathered up and began shaving. Oh boy!

I read about the Gillette Labs razor and heard how good it was, and then stumbled across the heated razor I could get as well.  It was expensive, but I waited and before Black Friday it went on sale with a big price drop.  Even so, it was about six times more expensive than the ordinary Gillette razors.I usually shave in the shower using women's shave oil, which you can find online or in a big box store (the women's oils have many different smells and the bottle is significantly bigger than the oil drops I used to use).  I wait until I have been in there a bit and my face warms up, and then the shave is smooth and easy.  This razor claims to heat your face like they do when you get a barbershop shave, but they say a lot.  I started working out and wanted to shave, but not shower at home until after my workout, which meant shaving with a cold face, and trying to warm up the blade in a sink of hot water.I used this new razor this morning.  It was set to the hottest setting and holy buckets, the shave was amazingly comfortable.  It heats in less than one second and it gets warm.  It really does feel like a hot towel barber shave and I thought I got just as good a shave, if not better because it felt luxurious, than the other Gillette I use in the shower.  It is amazing.  This razor was well worth the money I spent on it.  The only down-side is that I probably wont be able to buy the blade refills at my local big box membership store.  Alas.",

Let me tell you, this thing is a game changer!First of all, the heated razor feels like a hot towel is being draped over your face, making for a luxurious shaving experience. It's like a spa day in your own bathroom! The razor is designed with the same attention to detail as a Bugatti car, and I feel like I'm driving a luxury vehicle on my face.The shave itself is smooth and effortless, thanks to the five blades that effortlessly glide over your skin. The razor even has a FlexDisc technology which adapts to the contours of your face, ensuring a comfortable and close shave every time.The only downside is that my wife keeps trying to steal it for herself! I guess it's not just for men after all.The Bugatti Limited Edition Shave Kit comes with everything you need for the perfect shave, including a magnetic charging dock, a travel case, and even a premium shaving cream. It's the ultimate shaving kit for the man who wants to look and feel his best.Overall, I would highly recommend the Gillette Heated Razor for Men, Bugatti Limited Edition Shave Kit by GilletteLabs to any man (or woman!) who wants to elevate their shaving experience to the next level.

I have used many razors in my time, actually spending more on certain brands than this one, but I have to tell you, this was the most comfortable, accurate, smooth shave that I have ever had. I was astonished and greatly impressed. The razor cut through my 4 day beard like butter. The absolute closest, comfortable and easiest shave I have ever had. The price may be a little high for some but to get an excellent comfortable shave is worth every penny. Refills are a little pricey but if I can get 10 shaves with each blade, this is a home run for me. I would have liked a little hotter heat strip but that's just me.  THIS IS A WINNER IN MY BOOK !",

I was hesitant to try this razor but not at that exorbitant price of $200+! I waited til it came down to $112,(although it\u2019s probably worth no more than $50 tops.) I will say it\u2019s really easy to use, charge, and switch temperatures on the blade.I used it for the first time in my shower, with shave cream, and got a really nice, smooth shave with zero irritation. The warm blade felt nice against the skin. Now, I\u2019ve read plenty of comments of \u201cwhy not just run your razor under hot water instead?\u201d Go ahead, and you\u2019ll have to do that over and over again! It\u2019s not going to continuously give the same feeling as the heated bar below the razor.Now, am I looking forward to paying a premium for replacement blades, no. Here\u2019s the thing though, I can stretch the life span out because I have different razors, and a few electric ones. I like to switch it up from time to time lol!Bottom line is it\u2019s not as bad as all the whiny reviews I\u2019ve read, but it\u2019s not for everyone either. It would be better priced around $50, but so far I do like it. You be the judge.Update: I\u2019m one month into using this razor now, 6 or 7 shaves all in the shower. Before I had to thoroughly wet my face with hot water to keep from the razor tugging my hair as I shave, but not with this razor. As soon as I apply shave cream and turn the heating element on, I\u2019m shaving tug free within 3-4 seconds. The heating element feels nice against the skin, and I really do get a nice, smooth shave. The top blue strip on the razor blade is starting to wear away some, but I\u2019m still getting a good shave from the initial blade.Will update again if things change.UPDATE 2:Razor handle quit charging on 4-18, not even 6 months into using it.I contacted Gillette via the chat feature on their webpage, had to provide proof of purchase through Amazon, and a few days later received a new kit in the mail.The short life of the charging handle does worry me some, but at least Gillette stood behind their product, and gave me a hassle free replacement.Will update again if need be.",

I was hesitant to try this razor but not at that exorbitant price of $200+! I waited til it came down to $112,(although it\u2019s probably worth no more than $50 tops.) I will say it\u2019s really easy to use, charge, and switch temperatures on the blade.I used it for the first time in my shower, with shave cream, and got a really nice, smooth shave with zero irritation. The warm blade felt nice against the skin. Now, I\u2019ve read plenty of comments of \u201cwhy not just run your razor under hot water instead?\u201d Go ahead, and you\u2019ll have to do that over and over again! It\u2019s not going to continuously give the same feeling as the heated bar below the razor.Now, am I looking forward to paying a premium for replacement blades, no. Here\u2019s the thing though, I can stretch the life span out because I have different razors, and a few electric ones. I like to switch it up from time to time lol!Bottom line is it\u2019s not as bad as all the whiny reviews I\u2019ve read, but it\u2019s not for everyone either. It would be better priced around $50, but so far I do like it. You be the judge.Update: I\u2019m one month into using this razor now, 6 or 7 shaves all in the shower. Before I had to thoroughly wet my face with hot water to keep from the razor tugging my hair as I shave, but not with this razor. As soon as I apply shave cream and turn the heating element on, I\u2019m shaving tug free within 3-4 seconds. The heating element feels nice against the skin, and I really do get a nice, smooth shave. The top blue strip on the razor blade is starting to wear away some, but I\u2019m still getting a good shave from the initial blade.Will update again if things change.UPDATE 2:Razor handle quit charging on 4-18, not even 6 months into using it.I contacted Gillette via the chat feature on their webpage, had to provide proof of purchase through Amazon, and a few days later received a new kit in the mail.The short life of the charging handle does worry me some, but at least Gillette stood behind their product, and gave me a hassle free replacement.Will update again if need be.",

I was hesitant to try this razor but not at that exorbitant price of $200+! I waited til it came down to $112,(although it\u2019s probably worth no more than $50 tops.) I will say it\u2019s really easy to use, charge, and switch temperatures on the blade.I used it for the first time in my shower, with shave cream, and got a really nice, smooth shave with zero irritation. The warm blade felt nice against the skin. Now, I\u2019ve read plenty of comments of \u201cwhy not just run your razor under hot water instead?\u201d Go ahead, and you\u2019ll have to do that over and over again! It\u2019s not going to continuously give the same feeling as the heated bar below the razor.Now, am I looking forward to paying a premium for replacement blades, no. Here\u2019s the thing though, I can stretch the life span out because I have different razors, and a few electric ones. I like to switch it up from time to time lol!Bottom line is it\u2019s not as bad as all the whiny reviews I\u2019ve read, but it\u2019s not for everyone either. It would be better priced around $50, but so far I do like it. You be the judge.Update: I\u2019m one month into using this razor now, 6 or 7 shaves all in the shower. Before I had to thoroughly wet my face with hot water to keep from the razor tugging my hair as I shave, but not with this razor. As soon as I apply shave cream and turn the heating element on, I\u2019m shaving tug free within 3-4 seconds. The heating element feels nice against the skin, and I really do get a nice, smooth shave. The top blue strip on the razor blade is starting to wear away some, but I\u2019m still getting a good shave from the initial blade.Will update again if things change.UPDATE 2:Razor handle quit charging on 4-18, not even 6 months into using it.I contacted Gillette via the chat feature on their webpage, had to provide proof of purchase through Amazon, and a few days later received a new kit in the mail.The short life of the charging handle does worry me some, but at least Gillette stood behind their product, and gave me a hassle free replacement.Will update again if need be.",

They drop down a little in sharpness but then seem to stay at that level for months so you can either change them every week or two to three times per year.  Now the problem.  I've had 4 of these.  With daily use the battery fails after 13 or 14 months.  Gillette will not offer an exchange or sell you just the razor without the expensive packaging and charger.  They may offer a slight discount but it's the same as their occasional sale price.  This applies to both the Bugatti edition and the regular.  No one appears to have figured out how to open the handle to change the battery.  I have 3 failed units.  I tried heat and solvent to open the first one with no luck.  Next I'm going to try to saw one open.Gillette needs to either fix their charge circuit that is destroying the battery or offer to exchange the razor at some reasonable cost, maybe $45 after the 12 month warranty.",

With daily use the battery fails after 13 or 14 months.  Gillette will not offer an exchange or sell you just the razor without the expensive packaging and charger.  They may offer a slight discount but it's the same as their occasional sale price.  This applies to both the Bugatti edition and the regular.  No one appears to have figured out how to open the handle to change the battery.  I have 3 failed units.  I tried heat and solvent to open the first one with no luck.  Next I'm going to try to saw one open.Gillette needs to either fix their charge circuit that is destroying the battery or offer to exchange the razor at some reasonable cost, maybe $45 after the 12 month warranty.",

Much to my disappointment this device had the same problem after 10 months, again within the warranty of the replacement device.Gillette was very kind to again immediately send a replacement. Regrettably, this replacement device\u2019s battery was \u201cdead on arrival\u201d. I was requested to send the defect devices to the Gillette Repair center. Supposedly to verify that the devices were indeed defect. I received again new device in August 2023. But today, December 15 2023, the razor failed again after only 5 months.So that were 4 defect devices in two years. Obviously, Gillette has some serious quality problems. Please don\u2019t buy this product, you will be very disappointed.",

You want the hairs on your face to be soft and heated and use a cold blade. For example, when sharpening my chef knife, I use cold water on my whetstone so the molecules contract in the stone and become stronger while I put my chef knife under extremely hot water. Once the blade is sharp, I run the chef knife under cold water for a sharper blade. Heating the blade itself will make the blade less sharp. If you want a close shave, use a heated towel on your face, shaving cream, and a very cold blade for the best results. I feel like Gillette should know these basic concepts to the art of shaving.",

You want the hairs on your face to be soft and heated and use a cold blade. For example, when sharpening my chef knife, I use cold water on my whetstone so the molecules contract in the stone and become stronger while I put my chef knife under extremely hot water. Once the blade is sharp, I run the chef knife under cold water for a sharper blade. Heating the blade itself will make the blade less sharp. If you want a close shave, use a heated towel on your face, shaving cream, and a very cold blade for the best results. I feel like Gillette should know these basic concepts to the art of shaving.",

I was hesitant to try this razor but not at that exorbitant price of $200+! I waited til it came down to $112,(although it\u2019s probably worth no more than $50 tops.) I will say it\u2019s really easy to use, charge, and switch temperatures on the blade.I used it for the first time in my shower, with shave cream, and got a really nice, smooth shave with zero irritation. The warm blade felt nice against the skin. Now, I\u2019ve read plenty of comments of \u201cwhy not just run your razor under hot water instead?\u201d Go ahead, and you\u2019ll have to do that over and over again! It\u2019s not going to continuously give the same feeling as the heated bar below the razor.Now, am I looking forward to paying a premium for replacement blades, no. Here\u2019s the thing though, I can stretch the life span out because I have different razors, and a few electric ones. I like to switch it up from time to time lol!Bottom line is it\u2019s not as bad as all the whiny reviews I\u2019ve read, but it\u2019s not for everyone either. It would be better priced around $50, but so far I do like it. You be the judge.Update: I\u2019m one month into using this razor now, 6 or 7 shaves all in the shower. Before I had to thoroughly wet my face with hot water to keep from the razor tugging my hair as I shave, but not with this razor. As soon as I apply shave cream and turn the heating element on, I\u2019m shaving tug free within 3-4 seconds. The heating element feels nice against the skin, and I really do get a nice, smooth shave. The top blue strip on the razor blade is starting to wear away some, but I\u2019m still getting a good shave from the initial blade.Will update again if things change.UPDATE 2:Razor handle quit charging on 4-18, not even 6 months into using it.I contacted Gillette via the chat feature on their webpage, had to provide proof of purchase through Amazon, and a few days later received a new kit in the mail.The short life of the charging handle does worry me some, but at least Gillette stood behind their product, and gave me a hassle free replacement.Will update again if need be.",

            "body": "TL;DR: The Gillette Labs Heated Razor Gold Edition isn't a gimmick. It's a meticulously engineered shaving experience that leverages thermodynamics to deliver an unparalleled shave. But at a premium price, you can expect the razor to last 2-3 years before needing a total replacement.First Impressions: The Gold Edition oozes luxury. The weighty, gold-trimmed handle feels substantial, while the inductive charging dock screams sophistication. But the true star is the heated blade cartridge. Gillette's micro-heater tech raises the temperature to a precise 122\u00b0F in 0.5 seconds.The Shave: Ah, the shave itself. It's like a warm hug on your face. The heated blade glides effortlessly, prepping hair for the five-blade onslaught. Gone are the days of pre-shave oil\u2014the warmth acts as a lubricant, minimizing friction and irritation. The result? It was a shockingly close shave with minimal razor burn, even on my notoriously sensitive skin.Tech Talk: This razor is a marvel of miniaturization. The lithium-ion battery tucked within the handle powers the heater for up to six shaves while the temperature sensors constantly monitor and adjust heat output for optimal comfort and safety.But it could be better. The hefty price tag might sting, and the proprietary blade cartridges add to the long-term cost. Plus, the temperature range is limited, and some might miss the ritual of a hot shower shave.Verdict: The Gillette Labs Heated Razor Gold Edition is a game-changer. It's not just a razor; it's an investment in a luxurious, comfortable, and technically impressive shaving experience.",

I read about the Gillette Labs razor and heard how good it was, and then stumbled across the heated razor I could get as well.  It was expensive, but I waited and before Black Friday it went on sale with a big price drop.  Even so, it was about six times more expensive than the ordinary Gillette razors.I usually shave in the shower using women's shave oil, which you can find online or in a big box store (the women's oils have many different smells and the bottle is significantly bigger than the oil drops I used to use).  I wait until I have been in there a bit and my face warms up, and then the shave is smooth and easy.  This razor claims to heat your face like they do when you get a barbershop shave, but they say a lot.  I started working out and wanted to shave, but not shower at home until after my workout, which meant shaving with a cold face, and trying to warm up the blade in a sink of hot water.I used this new razor this morning.  It was set to the hottest setting and holy buckets, the shave was amazingly comfortable.  It heats in less than one second and it gets warm.  It really does feel like a hot towel barber shave and I thought I got just as good a shave, if not better because it felt luxurious, than the other Gillette I use in the shower.  It is amazing.  This razor was well worth the money I spent on it.  The only down-side is that I probably wont be able to buy the blade refills at my local big box membership store.  Alas.",

Let me tell you, this thing is a game changer!First of all, the heated razor feels like a hot towel is being draped over your face, making for a luxurious shaving experience. It's like a spa day in your own bathroom!

The razor even has a FlexDisc technology which adapts to the contours of your face, ensuring a comfortable and close shave every time.The only downside is that my wife keeps trying to steal it for herself! I guess it's not just for men after all.The Bugatti Limited Edition Shave Kit comes with everything you need for the perfect shave, including a magnetic charging dock, a travel case, and even a premium shaving cream. It's the ultimate shaving kit for the man who wants to look and feel his best.Overall, I would highly recommend the Gillette Heated Razor for Men, Bugatti Limited Edition Shave Kit by GilletteLabs to any man (or woman!) who wants to elevate their shaving experience to the next level.

I have used many razors in my time, actually spending more on certain brands than this one, but I have to tell you, this was the most comfortable, accurate, smooth shave that I have ever had. I was astonished and greatly impressed. The razor cut through my 4 day beard like butter. The absolute closest, comfortable and easiest shave I have ever had. The price may be a little high for some but to get an excellent comfortable shave is worth every penny. Refills are a little pricey but if I can get 10 shaves with each blade, this is a home run for me. I would have liked a little hotter heat strip but that's just me.  THIS IS A WINNER IN MY BOOK !",

I was hesitant to try this razor but not at that exorbitant price of $200+! I waited til it came down to $112,(although it\u2019s probably worth no more than $50 tops.) I will say it\u2019s really easy to use, charge, and switch temperatures on the blade.I used it for the first time in my shower, with shave cream, and got a really nice, smooth shave with zero irritation. The warm blade felt nice against the skin. Now, I\u2019ve read plenty of comments of \u201cwhy not just run your razor under hot water instead?\u201d Go ahead, and you\u2019ll have to do that over and over again! It\u2019s not going to continuously give the same feeling as the heated bar below the razor.Now, am I looking forward to paying a premium for replacement blades, no. Here\u2019s the thing though, I can stretch the life span out because I have different razors, and a few electric ones. I like to switch it up from time to time lol!Bottom line is it\u2019s not as bad as all the whiny reviews I\u2019ve read, but it\u2019s not for everyone either. It would be better priced around $50, but so far I do like it. You be the judge.Update: I\u2019m one month into using this razor now, 6 or 7 shaves all in the shower. Before I had to thoroughly wet my face with hot water to keep from the razor tugging my hair as I shave, but not with this razor. As soon as I apply shave cream and turn the heating element on, I\u2019m shaving tug free within 3-4 seconds. The heating element feels nice against the skin, and I really do get a nice, smooth shave. The top blue strip on the razor blade is starting to wear away some, but I\u2019m still getting a good shave from the initial blade.Will update again if things change.UPDATE 2:Razor handle quit charging on 4-18, not even 6 months into using it.I contacted Gillette via the chat feature on their webpage, had to provide proof of purchase through Amazon, and a few days later received a new kit in the mail.The short life of the charging handle does worry me some, but at least Gillette stood behind their product, and gave me a hassle free replacement.Will update again if need be.",

I was hesitant to try this razor but not at that exorbitant price of $200+! I waited til it came down to $112,(although it\u2019s probably worth no more than $50 tops.) I will say it\u2019s really easy to use, charge, and switch temperatures on the blade.I used it for the first time in my shower, with shave cream, and got a really nice, smooth shave with zero irritation. The warm blade felt nice against the skin. Now, I\u2019ve read plenty of comments of \u201cwhy not just run your razor under hot water instead?\u201d Go ahead, and you\u2019ll have to do that over and over again! It\u2019s not going to continuously give the same feeling as the heated bar below the razor.Now, am I looking forward to paying a premium for replacement blades, no. Here\u2019s the thing though, I can stretch the life span out because I have different razors, and a few electric ones. I like to switch it up from time to time lol!Bottom line is it\u2019s not as bad as all the whiny reviews I\u2019ve read, but it\u2019s not for everyone either. It would be better priced around $50, but so far I do like it. You be the judge.Update: I\u2019m one month into using this razor now, 6 or 7 shaves all in the shower. Before I had to thoroughly wet my face with hot water to keep from the razor tugging my hair as I shave, but not with this razor. As soon as I apply shave cream and turn the heating element on, I\u2019m shaving tug free within 3-4 seconds. The heating element feels nice against the skin, and I really do get a nice, smooth shave. The top blue strip on the razor blade is starting to wear away some, but I\u2019m still getting a good shave from the initial blade.Will update again if things change.UPDATE 2:Razor handle quit charging on 4-18, not even 6 months into using it.I contacted Gillette via the chat feature on their webpage, had to provide proof of purchase through Amazon, and a few days later received a new kit in the mail.The short life of the charging handle does worry me some, but at least Gillette stood behind their product, and gave me a hassle free replacement.Will update again if need be.",

When I opened the box and looked at the Bugatti, I thought that it would nick my face like crazy. Anyway I lathered up and began shaving. Oh boy!

I read about the Gillette Labs razor and heard how good it was, and then stumbled across the heated razor I could get as well.  It was expensive, but I waited and before Black Friday it went on sale with a big price drop.  Even so, it was about six times more expensive than the ordinary Gillette razors.I usually shave in the shower using women's shave oil, which you can find online or in a big box store (the women's oils have many different smells and the bottle is significantly bigger than the oil drops I used to use).  I wait until I have been in there a bit and my face warms up, and then the shave is smooth and easy.  This razor claims to heat your face like they do when you get a barbershop shave, but they say a lot.  I started working out and wanted to shave, but not shower at home until after my workout, which meant shaving with a cold face, and trying to warm up the blade in a sink of hot water.I used this new razor this morning.  It was set to the hottest setting and holy buckets, the shave was amazingly comfortable.  It heats in less than one second and it gets warm.  It really does feel like a hot towel barber shave and I thought I got just as good a shave, if not better because it felt luxurious, than the other Gillette I use in the shower.  It is amazing.  This razor was well worth the money I spent on it.  The only down-side is that I probably wont be able to buy the blade refills at my local big box membership store.  Alas.",

I was astonished and greatly impressed. The razor cut through my 4 day beard like butter. The absolute closest, comfortable and easiest shave I have ever had. The price may be a little high for some but to get an excellent comfortable shave is worth every penny. Refills are a little pricey but if I can get 10 shaves with each blade, this is a home run for me. I would have liked a little hotter heat strip but that's just me.  THIS IS A WINNER IN MY BOOK !",

I actually use it in the shower and it is nothing short of a miracle for me.  It shaves very close and I do not get the razor bumps I got before.  The charge really lasts for 6 shaves and it is absolutely the best shave I have ever gotten with a razor.  It was worth every penny but I wish the cartridges were not $6+ each.",

I was hesitant to try this razor but not at that exorbitant price of $200+! I waited til it came down to $112,(although it\u2019s probably worth no more than $50 tops.) I will say it\u2019s really easy to use, charge, and switch temperatures on the blade.I used it for the first time in my shower, with shave cream, and got a really nice, smooth shave with zero irritation. The warm blade felt nice against the skin. Now, I\u2019ve read plenty of comments of \u201cwhy not just run your razor under hot water instead?\u201d Go ahead, and you\u2019ll have to do that over and over again! It\u2019s not going to continuously give the same feeling as the heated bar below the razor.Now, am I looking forward to paying a premium for replacement blades, no. Here\u2019s the thing though, I can stretch the life span out because I have different razors, and a few electric ones. I like to switch it up from time to time lol!Bottom line is it\u2019s not as bad as all the whiny reviews I\u2019ve read, but it\u2019s not for everyone either. It would be better priced around $50, but so far I do like it. You be the judge.Update: I\u2019m one month into using this razor now, 6 or 7 shaves all in the shower. Before I had to thoroughly wet my face with hot water to keep from the razor tugging my hair as I shave, but not with this razor. As soon as I apply shave cream and turn the heating element on, I\u2019m shaving tug free within 3-4 seconds. The heating element feels nice against the skin, and I really do get a nice, smooth shave. The top blue strip on the razor blade is starting to wear away some, but I\u2019m still getting a good shave from the initial blade.Will update again if things change.UPDATE 2:Razor handle quit charging on 4-18, not even 6 months into using it.I contacted Gillette via the chat feature on their webpage, had to provide proof of purchase through Amazon, and a few days later received a new kit in the mail.The short life of the charging handle does worry me some, but at least Gillette stood behind their product, and gave me a hassle free replacement.Will update again if need be.",

With daily use the battery fails after 13 or 14 months.  Gillette will not offer an exchange or sell you just the razor without the expensive packaging and charger.  They may offer a slight discount but it's the same as their occasional sale price.  This applies to both the Bugatti edition and the regular.  No one appears to have figured out how to open the handle to change the battery.  I have 3 failed units.  I tried heat and solvent to open the first one with no luck.  Next I'm going to try to saw one open.Gillette needs to either fix their charge circuit that is destroying the battery or offer to exchange the razor at some reasonable cost, maybe $45 after the 12 month warranty.",

Much to my disappointment this device had the same problem after 10 months, again within the warranty of the replacement device.Gillette was very kind to again immediately send a replacement. Regrettably, this replacement device\u2019s battery was \u201cdead on arrival\u201d. I was requested to send the defect devices to the Gillette Repair center. Supposedly to verify that the devices were indeed defect. I received again new device in August 2023. But today, December 15 2023, the razor failed again after only 5 months.So that were 4 defect devices in two years. Obviously, Gillette has some serious quality problems. Please don\u2019t buy this product, you will be very disappointed.",

The price is way off, doesn't really get too hot (understandably), and a little bit clunky compared to other razors. The cool thing about it is that it has a magnetic stand that charges the razor and the look of the razor is really cool. To know that it heats up and gives you a warm fuzzy feeling inside is not really justifiable since overall it is really just a regular razor with a heating strip. The same razor without the heating strip, but exfoliating bar is on sale now and is worth the price more than this one. I still get razor bumps even while using the thickest shaving cream I could find, and yeah just not worth it.",

You want the hairs on your face to be soft and heated and use a cold blade. For example, when sharpening my chef knife, I use cold water on my whetstone so the molecules contract in the stone and become stronger while I put my chef knife under extremely hot water. Once the blade is sharp, I run the chef knife under cold water for a sharper blade. Heating the blade itself will make the blade less sharp. If you want a close shave, use a heated towel on your face, shaving cream, and a very cold blade for the best results. I feel like Gillette should know these basic concepts to the art of shaving.",

You want the hairs on your face to be soft and heated and use a cold blade. For example, when sharpening my chef knife, I use cold water on my whetstone so the molecules contract in the stone and become stronger while I put my chef knife under extremely hot water. Once the blade is sharp, I run the chef knife under cold water for a sharper blade. Heating the blade itself will make the blade less sharp. If you want a close shave, use a heated towel on your face, shaving cream, and a very cold blade for the best results. I feel like Gillette should know these basic concepts to the art of shaving.",

I was hesitant to try this razor but not at that exorbitant price of $200+! I waited til it came down to $112,(although it\u2019s probably worth no more than $50 tops.) I will say it\u2019s really easy to use, charge, and switch temperatures on the blade.I used it for the first time in my shower, with shave cream, and got a really nice, smooth shave with zero irritation. The warm blade felt nice against the skin. Now, I\u2019ve read plenty of comments of \u201cwhy not just run your razor under hot water instead?\u201d Go ahead, and you\u2019ll have to do that over and over again! It\u2019s not going to continuously give the same feeling as the heated bar below the razor.Now, am I looking forward to paying a premium for replacement blades, no. Here\u2019s the thing though, I can stretch the life span out because I have different razors, and a few electric ones. I like to switch it up from time to time lol!Bottom line is it\u2019s not as bad as all the whiny reviews I\u2019ve read, but it\u2019s not for everyone either. It would be better priced around $50, but so far I do like it. You be the judge.Update: I\u2019m one month into using this razor now, 6 or 7 shaves all in the shower. Before I had to thoroughly wet my face with hot water to keep from the razor tugging my hair as I shave, but not with this razor. As soon as I apply shave cream and turn the heating element on, I\u2019m shaving tug free within 3-4 seconds. The heating element feels nice against the skin, and I really do get a nice, smooth shave. The top blue strip on the razor blade is starting to wear away some, but I\u2019m still getting a good shave from the initial blade.Will update again if things change.UPDATE 2:Razor handle quit charging on 4-18, not even 6 months into using it.I contacted Gillette via the chat feature on their webpage, had to provide proof of purchase through Amazon, and a few days later received a new kit in the mail.The short life of the charging handle does worry me some, but at least Gillette stood behind their product, and gave me a hassle free replacement.Will update again if need be.",

            "body": "This is the first personal care item I have ever bought where I felt I splurged on myself.  I read about the Gillette Labs razor and heard how good it was, and then stumbled across the heated razor I could get as well.  It was expensive, but I waited and before Black Friday it went on sale with a big price drop.  Even so, it was about six times more expensive than the ordinary Gillette razors.I usually shave in the shower using women's shave oil, which you can find online or in a big box store (the women's oils have many different smells and the bottle is significantly bigger than the oil drops I used to use).  I wait until I have been in there a bit and my face warms up, and then the shave is smooth and easy.  This razor claims to heat your face like they do when you get a barbershop shave, but they say a lot.  I started working out and wanted to shave, but not shower at home until after my workout, which meant shaving with a cold face, and trying to warm up the blade in a sink of hot water.I used this new razor this morning.  It was set to the hottest setting and holy buckets, the shave was amazingly comfortable.  It heats in less than one second and it gets warm.  It really does feel like a hot towel barber shave and I thought I got just as good a shave, if not better because it felt luxurious, than the other Gillette I use in the shower.  It is amazing.  This razor was well worth the money I spent on it.  The only down-side is that I probably wont be able to buy the blade refills at my local big box membership store.  Alas.",

            "body": "TL;DR: The Gillette Labs Heated Razor Gold Edition isn't a gimmick. It's a meticulously engineered shaving experience that leverages thermodynamics to deliver an unparalleled shave. But at a premium price, you can expect the razor to last 2-3 years before needing a total replacement.First Impressions: The Gold Edition oozes luxury. The weighty, gold-trimmed handle feels substantial, while the inductive charging dock screams sophistication. But the true star is the heated blade cartridge. Gillette's micro-heater tech raises the temperature to a precise 122\u00b0F in 0.5 seconds.The Shave: Ah, the shave itself. It's like a warm hug on your face. The heated blade glides effortlessly, prepping hair for the five-blade onslaught. Gone are the days of pre-shave oil\u2014the warmth acts as a lubricant, minimizing friction and irritation. The result? It was a shockingly close shave with minimal razor burn, even on my notoriously sensitive skin.Tech Talk: This razor is a marvel of miniaturization. The lithium-ion battery tucked within the handle powers the heater for up to six shaves while the temperature sensors constantly monitor and adjust heat output for optimal comfort and safety.But it could be better. The hefty price tag might sting, and the proprietary blade cartridges add to the long-term cost. Plus, the temperature range is limited, and some might miss the ritual of a hot shower shave.Verdict: The Gillette Labs Heated Razor Gold Edition is a game-changer. It's not just a razor; it's an investment in a luxurious, comfortable, and technically impressive shaving experience.",

I have a sensitive face and tough beard. I was trying different razors to find one that was good for my face. When I opened the box and looked at the Bugatti, I thought that it would nick my face like crazy. Anyway I lathered up and began shaving. Oh boy!  Was I surprised at how smooth and nick free of a shave I got from it. This is my number one favorite razor to go to. Thank you Amazon, and thank you Gillette for finally inventing a razor that shaves without giving your face nicks",

They may offer a slight discount but it's the same as their occasional sale price.  This applies to both the Bugatti edition and the regular.  No one appears to have figured out how to open the handle to change the battery.  I have 3 failed units.  I tried heat and solvent to open the first one with no luck.

Previously, he only used regular razors, explaining that electric shavers didn't provide a close enough cut. But from his first use of this heated razor, he was incredibly impressed. He mentioned how the warmth felt like a hot towel, with the heat emanating from the handle rather than the blade. He's also very pleased with the closeness of the shave it provides. This razor has positively transformed his daily routine, making it an enjoyable experience.",

I was hesitant to try this razor but not at that exorbitant price of $200+! I waited til it came down to $112,(although it\u2019s probably worth no more than $50 tops.) I will say it\u2019s really easy to use, charge, and switch temperatures on the blade.I used it for the first time in my shower, with shave cream, and got a really nice, smooth shave with zero irritation. The warm blade felt nice against the skin. Now, I\u2019ve read plenty of comments of \u201cwhy not just run your razor under hot water instead?\u201d Go ahead, and you\u2019ll have to do that over and over again! It\u2019s not going to continuously give the same feeling as the heated bar below the razor.Now, am I looking forward to paying a premium for replacement blades, no. Here\u2019s the thing though, I can stretch the life span out because I have different razors, and a few electric ones. I like to switch it up from time to time lol!Bottom line is it\u2019s not as bad as all the whiny reviews I\u2019ve read, but it\u2019s not for everyone either. It would be better priced around $50, but so far I do like it. You be the judge.Update: I\u2019m one month into using this razor now, 6 or 7 shaves all in the shower. Before I had to thoroughly wet my face with hot water to keep from the razor tugging my hair as I shave, but not with this razor. As soon as I apply shave cream and turn the heating element on, I\u2019m shaving tug free within 3-4 seconds. The heating element feels nice against the skin, and I really do get a nice, smooth shave. The top blue strip on the razor blade is starting to wear away some, but I\u2019m still getting a good shave from the initial blade.Will update again if things change.UPDATE 2:Razor handle quit charging on 4-18, not even 6 months into using it.I contacted Gillette via the chat feature on their webpage, had to provide proof of purchase through Amazon, and a few days later received a new kit in the mail.The short life of the charging handle does worry me some, but at least Gillette stood behind their product, and gave me a hassle free replacement.Will update again if need be.",

I read about the Gillette Labs razor and heard how good it was, and then stumbled across the heated razor I could get as well.  It was expensive, but I waited and before Black Friday it went on sale with a big price drop.  Even so, it was about six times more expensive than the ordinary Gillette razors.I usually shave in the shower using women's shave oil, which you can find online or in a big box store (the women's oils have many different smells and the bottle is significantly bigger than the oil drops I used to use).  I wait until I have been in there a bit and my face warms up, and then the shave is smooth and easy.  This razor claims to heat your face like they do when you get a barbershop shave, but they say a lot.  I started working out and wanted to shave, but not shower at home until after my workout, which meant shaving with a cold face, and trying to warm up the blade in a sink of hot water.I used this new razor this morning.  It was set to the hottest setting and holy buckets, the shave was amazingly comfortable.  It heats in less than one second and it gets warm.  It really does feel like a hot towel barber shave and I thought I got just as good a shave, if not better because it felt luxurious, than the other Gillette I use in the shower.  It is amazing.

I have a sensitive face and tough beard. I was trying different razors to find one that was good for my face. When I opened the box and looked at the Bugatti, I thought that it would nick my face like crazy. Anyway I lathered up and began shaving. Oh boy!  Was I surprised at how smooth and nick free of a shave I got from it. This is my number one favorite razor to go to. Thank you Amazon, and thank you Gillette for finally inventing a razor that shaves without giving your face nicks",

With daily use the battery fails after 13 or 14 months.  Gillette will not offer an exchange or sell you just the razor without the expensive packaging and charger.  They may offer a slight discount but it's the same as their occasional sale price.  This applies to both the Bugatti edition and the regular.  No one appears to have figured out how to open the handle to change the battery.  I have 3 failed units.  I tried heat and solvent to open the first one with no luck.  Next I'm going to try to saw one open.Gillette needs to either fix their charge circuit that is destroying the battery or offer to exchange the razor at some reasonable cost, maybe $45 after the 12 month warranty.",

The price is way off, doesn't really get too hot (understandably), and a little bit clunky compared to other razors. The cool thing about it is that it has a magnetic stand that charges the razor and the look of the razor is really cool. To know that it heats up and gives you a warm fuzzy feeling inside is not really justifiable since overall it is really just a regular razor with a heating strip. The same razor without the heating strip, but exfoliating bar is on sale now and is worth the price more than this one. I still get razor bumps even while using the thickest shaving cream I could find, and yeah just not worth it.",

I read about the Gillette Labs razor and heard how good it was, and then stumbled across the heated razor I could get as well.  It was expensive, but I waited and before Black Friday it went on sale with a big price drop.  Even so, it was about six times more expensive than the ordinary Gillette razors.I usually shave in the shower using women's shave oil, which you can find online or in a big box store (the women's oils have many different smells and the bottle is significantly bigger than the oil drops I used to use).  I wait until I have been in there a bit and my face warms up, and then the shave is smooth and easy.  This razor claims to heat your face like they do when you get a barbershop shave, but they say a lot.  I started working out and wanted to shave, but not shower at home until after my workout, which meant shaving with a cold face, and trying to warm up the blade in a sink of hot water.I used this new razor this morning.  It was set to the hottest setting and holy buckets, the shave was amazingly comfortable.  It heats in less than one second and it gets warm.  It really does feel like a hot towel barber shave and I thought I got just as good a shave, if not better because it felt luxurious, than the other Gillette I use in the shower.  It is amazing.  This razor was well worth the money I spent on it.  The only down-side is that I probably wont be able to buy the blade refills at my local big box membership store.  Alas.",

It's a meticulously engineered shaving experience that leverages thermodynamics to deliver an unparalleled shave. But at a premium price, you can expect the razor to last 2-3 years before needing a total replacement.First Impressions: The Gold Edition oozes luxury. The weighty, gold-trimmed handle feels substantial, while the inductive charging dock screams sophistication. But the true star is the heated blade cartridge. Gillette's micro-heater tech raises the temperature to a precise 122\u00b0F in 0.5 seconds.The Shave: Ah, the shave itself. It's like a warm hug on your face. The heated blade glides effortlessly, prepping hair for the five-blade onslaught. Gone are the days of pre-shave oil\u2014the warmth acts as a lubricant, minimizing friction and irritation. The result? It was a shockingly close shave with minimal razor burn, even on my notoriously sensitive skin.Tech Talk: This razor is a marvel of miniaturization. The lithium-ion battery tucked within the handle powers the heater for up to six shaves while the temperature sensors constantly monitor and adjust heat output for optimal comfort and safety.But it could be better. The hefty price tag might sting, and the proprietary blade cartridges add to the long-term cost. Plus, the temperature range is limited, and some might miss the ritual of a hot shower shave.Verdict: The Gillette Labs Heated Razor Gold Edition is a game-changer. It's not just a razor; it's an investment in a luxurious, comfortable, and technically impressive shaving experience.",

When I opened the box and looked at the Bugatti, I thought that it would nick my face like crazy. Anyway I lathered up and began shaving. Oh boy!

I have used many razors in my time, actually spending more on certain brands than this one, but I have to tell you, this was the most comfortable, accurate, smooth shave that I have ever had. I was astonished and greatly impressed. The razor cut through my 4 day beard like butter. The absolute closest, comfortable and easiest shave I have ever had. The price may be a little high for some but to get an excellent comfortable shave is worth every penny. Refills are a little pricey but if I can get 10 shaves with each blade, this is a home run for me. I would have liked a little hotter heat strip but that's just me.  THIS IS A WINNER IN MY BOOK !",

Let me tell you, this thing is a game changer!First of all, the heated razor feels like a hot towel is being draped over your face, making for a luxurious shaving experience. It's like a spa day in your own bathroom! The razor is designed with the same attention to detail as a Bugatti car, and I feel like I'm driving a luxury vehicle on my face.The shave itself is smooth and effortless, thanks to the five blades that effortlessly glide over your skin. The razor even has a FlexDisc technology which adapts to the contours of your face, ensuring a comfortable and close shave every time.The only downside is that my wife keeps trying to steal it for herself! I guess it's not just for men after all.The Bugatti Limited Edition Shave Kit comes with everything you need for the perfect shave, including a magnetic charging dock, a travel case, and even a premium shaving cream. It's the ultimate shaving kit for the man who wants to look and feel his best.Overall, I would highly recommend the Gillette Heated Razor for Men, Bugatti Limited Edition Shave Kit by GilletteLabs to any man (or woman!) who wants to elevate their shaving experience to the next level.

I read about the Gillette Labs razor and heard how good it was, and then stumbled across the heated razor I could get as well.  It was expensive, but I waited and before Black Friday it went on sale with a big price drop.  Even so, it was about six times more expensive than the ordinary Gillette razors.I usually shave in the shower using women's shave oil, which you can find online or in a big box store (the women's oils have many different smells and the bottle is significantly bigger than the oil drops I used to use).  I wait until I have been in there a bit and my face warms up, and then the shave is smooth and easy.  This razor claims to heat your face like they do when you get a barbershop shave, but they say a lot.  I started working out and wanted to shave, but not shower at home until after my workout, which meant shaving with a cold face, and trying to warm up the blade in a sink of hot water.I used this new razor this morning.  It was set to the hottest setting and holy buckets, the shave was amazingly comfortable.  It heats in less than one second and it gets warm.  It really does feel like a hot towel barber shave and I thought I got just as good a shave, if not better because it felt luxurious, than the other Gillette I use in the shower.  It is amazing.  This razor was well worth the money I spent on it.  The only down-side is that I probably wont be able to buy the blade refills at my local big box membership store.  Alas.",

When I opened the box and looked at the Bugatti, I thought that it would nick my face like crazy. Anyway I lathered up and began shaving. Oh boy!  Was I surprised at how smooth and nick free of a shave I got from it. This is my number one favorite razor to go to.

I have used many razors in my time, actually spending more on certain brands than this one, but I have to tell you, this was the most comfortable, accurate, smooth shave that I have ever had. I was astonished and greatly impressed. The razor cut through my 4 day beard like butter. The absolute closest, comfortable and easiest shave I have ever had. The price may be a little high for some but to get an excellent comfortable shave is worth every penny. Refills are a little pricey but if I can get 10 shaves with each blade, this is a home run for me. I would have liked a little hotter heat strip but that's just me.  THIS IS A WINNER IN MY BOOK !",

It's like a spa day in your own bathroom! The razor is designed with the same attention to detail as a Bugatti car, and I feel like I'm driving a luxury vehicle on my face.The shave itself is smooth and effortless, thanks to the five blades that effortlessly glide over your skin. The razor even has a FlexDisc technology which adapts to the contours of your face, ensuring a comfortable and close shave every time.The only downside is that my wife keeps trying to steal it for herself! I guess it's not just for men after all.The Bugatti Limited Edition Shave Kit comes with everything you need for the perfect shave, including a magnetic charging dock, a travel case, and even a premium shaving cream. It's the ultimate shaving kit for the man who wants to look and feel his best.Overall, I would highly recommend the Gillette Heated Razor for Men, Bugatti Limited Edition Shave Kit by GilletteLabs to any man (or woman!) who wants to elevate their shaving experience to the next level.

I was hesitant to try this razor but not at that exorbitant price of $200+! I waited til it came down to $112,(although it\u2019s probably worth no more than $50 tops.) I will say it\u2019s really easy to use, charge, and switch temperatures on the blade.I used it for the first time in my shower, with shave cream, and got a really nice, smooth shave with zero irritation. The warm blade felt nice against the skin. Now, I\u2019ve read plenty of comments of \u201cwhy not just run your razor under hot water instead?\u201d Go ahead, and you\u2019ll have to do that over and over again! It\u2019s not going to continuously give the same feeling as the heated bar below the razor.Now, am I looking forward to paying a premium for replacement blades, no. Here\u2019s the thing though, I can stretch the life span out because I have different razors, and a few electric ones. I like to switch it up from time to time lol!Bottom line is it\u2019s not as bad as all the whiny reviews I\u2019ve read, but it\u2019s not for everyone either. It would be better priced around $50, but so far I do like it. You be the judge.Update: I\u2019m one month into using this razor now, 6 or 7 shaves all in the shower. Before I had to thoroughly wet my face with hot water to keep from the razor tugging my hair as I shave, but not with this razor. As soon as I apply shave cream and turn the heating element on, I\u2019m shaving tug free within 3-4 seconds. The heating element feels nice against the skin, and I really do get a nice, smooth shave. The top blue strip on the razor blade is starting to wear away some, but I\u2019m still getting a good shave from the initial blade.Will update again if things change.UPDATE 2:Razor handle quit charging on 4-18, not even 6 months into using it.I contacted Gillette via the chat feature on their webpage, had to provide proof of purchase through Amazon, and a few days later received a new kit in the mail.The short life of the charging handle does worry me some, but at least Gillette stood behind their product, and gave me a hassle free replacement.Will update again if need be.",

They drop down a little in sharpness but then seem to stay at that level for months so you can either change them every week or two to three times per year.  Now the problem.  I've had 4 of these.  With daily use the battery fails after 13 or 14 months.  Gillette will not offer an exchange or sell you just the razor without the expensive packaging and charger.  They may offer a slight discount but it's the same as their occasional sale price.  This applies to both the Bugatti edition and the regular.  No one appears to have figured out how to open the handle to change the battery.  I have 3 failed units.  I tried heat and solvent to open the first one with no luck.  Next I'm going to try to saw one open.Gillette needs to either fix their charge circuit that is destroying the battery or offer to exchange the razor at some reasonable cost, maybe $45 after the 12 month warranty.",

With daily use the battery fails after 13 or 14 months.  Gillette will not offer an exchange or sell you just the razor without the expensive packaging and charger.  They may offer a slight discount but it's the same as their occasional sale price.  This applies to both the Bugatti edition and the regular.  No one appears to have figured out how to open the handle to change the battery.  I have 3 failed units.  I tried heat and solvent to open the first one with no luck.  Next I'm going to try to saw one open.Gillette needs to either fix their charge circuit that is destroying the battery or offer to exchange the razor at some reasonable cost, maybe $45 after the 12 month warranty.",

It is a basic razor with the added function of a heating system which is exactly the same as a cheap $15 to $20 razor set. The blades last just as long (sarcasm!) as the basic razor set from Gillette however these blades are twice as expensive. I am so upset I spent the almost $200 on this product and wish I could return it because it is a disappointment. Would not recommend to my friends or family.",

You want the hairs on your face to be soft and heated and use a cold blade. For example, when sharpening my chef knife, I use cold water on my whetstone so the molecules contract in the stone and become stronger while I put my chef knife under extremely hot water. Once the blade is sharp, I run the chef knife under cold water for a sharper blade. Heating the blade itself will make the blade less sharp. If you want a close shave, use a heated towel on your face, shaving cream, and a very cold blade for the best results. I feel like Gillette should know these basic concepts to the art of shaving.",

You want the hairs on your face to be soft and heated and use a cold blade. For example, when sharpening my chef knife, I use cold water on my whetstone so the molecules contract in the stone and become stronger while I put my chef knife under extremely hot water. Once the blade is sharp, I run the chef knife under cold water for a sharper blade. Heating the blade itself will make the blade less sharp. If you want a close shave, use a heated towel on your face, shaving cream, and a very cold blade for the best results. I feel like Gillette should know these basic concepts to the art of shaving.",

I was hesitant to try this razor but not at that exorbitant price of $200+! I waited til it came down to $112,(although it\u2019s probably worth no more than $50 tops.) I will say it\u2019s really easy to use, charge, and switch temperatures on the blade.I used it for the first time in my shower, with shave cream, and got a really nice, smooth shave with zero irritation. The warm blade felt nice against the skin. Now, I\u2019ve read plenty of comments of \u201cwhy not just run your razor under hot water instead?\u201d Go ahead, and you\u2019ll have to do that over and over again! It\u2019s not going to continuously give the same feeling as the heated bar below the razor.Now, am I looking forward to paying a premium for replacement blades, no. Here\u2019s the thing though, I can stretch the life span out because I have different razors, and a few electric ones. I like to switch it up from time to time lol!Bottom line is it\u2019s not as bad as all the whiny reviews I\u2019ve read, but it\u2019s not for everyone either. It would be better priced around $50, but so far I do like it. You be the judge.Update: I\u2019m one month into using this razor now, 6 or 7 shaves all in the shower. Before I had to thoroughly wet my face with hot water to keep from the razor tugging my hair as I shave, but not with this razor. As soon as I apply shave cream and turn the heating element on, I\u2019m shaving tug free within 3-4 seconds. The heating element feels nice against the skin, and I really do get a nice, smooth shave. The top blue strip on the razor blade is starting to wear away some, but I\u2019m still getting a good shave from the initial blade.Will update again if things change.UPDATE 2:Razor handle quit charging on 4-18, not even 6 months into using it.I contacted Gillette via the chat feature on their webpage, had to provide proof of purchase through Amazon, and a few days later received a new kit in the mail.The short life of the charging handle does worry me some, but at least Gillette stood behind their product, and gave me a hassle free replacement.Will update again if need be.",

I read about the Gillette Labs razor and heard how good it was, and then stumbled across the heated razor I could get as well.  It was expensive, but I waited and before Black Friday it went on sale with a big price drop.  Even so, it was about six times more expensive than the ordinary Gillette razors.I usually shave in the shower using women's shave oil, which you can find online or in a big box store (the women's oils have many different smells and the bottle is significantly bigger than the oil drops I used to use).  I wait until I have been in there a bit and my face warms up, and then the shave is smooth and easy.  This razor claims to heat your face like they do when you get a barbershop shave, but they say a lot.  I started working out and wanted to shave, but not shower at home until after my workout, which meant shaving with a cold face, and trying to warm up the blade in a sink of hot water.I used this new razor this morning.  It was set to the hottest setting and holy buckets, the shave was amazingly comfortable.  It heats in less than one second and it gets warm.  It really does feel like a hot towel barber shave and I thought I got just as good a shave, if not better because it felt luxurious, than the other Gillette I use in the shower.  It is amazing.  This razor was well worth the money I spent on it.  The only down-side is that I probably wont be able to buy the blade refills at my local big box membership store.  Alas.",

It's a meticulously engineered shaving experience that leverages thermodynamics to deliver an unparalleled shave. But at a premium price, you can expect the razor to last 2-3 years before needing a total replacement.First Impressions: The Gold Edition oozes luxury. The weighty, gold-trimmed handle feels substantial, while the inductive charging dock screams sophistication. But the true star is the heated blade cartridge. Gillette's micro-heater tech raises the temperature to a precise 122\u00b0F in 0.5 seconds.The Shave: Ah, the shave itself. It's like a warm hug on your face. The heated blade glides effortlessly, prepping hair for the five-blade onslaught. Gone are the days of pre-shave oil\u2014the warmth acts as a lubricant, minimizing friction and irritation. The result? It was a shockingly close shave with minimal razor burn, even on my notoriously sensitive skin.Tech Talk: This razor is a marvel of miniaturization. The lithium-ion battery tucked within the handle powers the heater for up to six shaves while the temperature sensors constantly monitor and adjust heat output for optimal comfort and safety.But it could be better. The hefty price tag might sting, and the proprietary blade cartridges add to the long-term cost. Plus, the temperature range is limited, and some might miss the ritual of a hot shower shave.Verdict: The Gillette Labs Heated Razor Gold Edition is a game-changer. It's not just a razor; it's an investment in a luxurious, comfortable, and technically impressive shaving experience.",

When I opened the box and looked at the Bugatti, I thought that it would nick my face like crazy. Anyway I lathered up and began shaving. Oh boy!  Was I surprised at how smooth and nick free of a shave I got from it. This is my number one favorite razor to go to. Thank you Amazon, and thank you Gillette for finally inventing a razor that shaves without giving your face nicks",

Long slow strokes pressing the warm bar against your face as you go slowwwlyy. Feel its warmth, and shave like a guy who owns a bugatti.  Luxuriously.  Seriously tho, once you get it you get it and the blades are top notch, but shaving like a disposable in a public restroom yeah I can see where people aren\u2019t getting the desired effect.

I was hesitant to try this razor but not at that exorbitant price of $200+! I waited til it came down to $112,(although it\u2019s probably worth no more than $50 tops.) I will say it\u2019s really easy to use, charge, and switch temperatures on the blade.I used it for the first time in my shower, with shave cream, and got a really nice, smooth shave with zero irritation. The warm blade felt nice against the skin. Now, I\u2019ve read plenty of comments of \u201cwhy not just run your razor under hot water instead?\u201d Go ahead, and you\u2019ll have to do that over and over again! It\u2019s not going to continuously give the same feeling as the heated bar below the razor.Now, am I looking forward to paying a premium for replacement blades, no. Here\u2019s the thing though, I can stretch the life span out because I have different razors, and a few electric ones. I like to switch it up from time to time lol!Bottom line is it\u2019s not as bad as all the whiny reviews I\u2019ve read, but it\u2019s not for everyone either. It would be better priced around $50, but so far I do like it. You be the judge.Update: I\u2019m one month into using this razor now, 6 or 7 shaves all in the shower. Before I had to thoroughly wet my face with hot water to keep from the razor tugging my hair as I shave, but not with this razor. As soon as I apply shave cream and turn the heating element on, I\u2019m shaving tug free within 3-4 seconds. The heating element feels nice against the skin, and I really do get a nice, smooth shave. The top blue strip on the razor blade is starting to wear away some, but I\u2019m still getting a good shave from the initial blade.Will update again if things change.UPDATE 2:Razor handle quit charging on 4-18, not even 6 months into using it.I contacted Gillette via the chat feature on their webpage, had to provide proof of purchase through Amazon, and a few days later received a new kit in the mail.The short life of the charging handle does worry me some, but at least Gillette stood behind their product, and gave me a hassle free replacement.Will update again if need be.",

I am semi retired and usually shave every other day but It was 4 days since my last shave, with more stubble so I was a little hesitant about it's ability. I lathered up and used the razor. I have used many razors in my time, actually spending more on certain brands than this one, but I have to tell you, this was the most comfortable, accurate, smooth shave that I have ever had. I was astonished and greatly impressed. The razor cut through my 4 day beard like butter. The absolute closest, comfortable and easiest shave I have ever had. The price may be a little high for some but to get an excellent comfortable shave is worth every penny. Refills are a little pricey but if I can get 10 shaves with each blade, this is a home run for me. I would have liked a little hotter heat strip but that's just me.  THIS IS A WINNER IN MY BOOK !",

            "body": "As a man who loves a good shave, I was excited to try out the Gillette Heated Razor for Men, Bugatti Limited Edition Shave Kit by GilletteLabs. Let me tell you, this thing is a game changer!First of all, the heated razor feels like a hot towel is being draped over your face, making for a luxurious shaving experience. It's like a spa day in your own bathroom! The razor is designed with the same attention to detail as a Bugatti car, and I feel like I'm driving a luxury vehicle on my face.The shave itself is smooth and effortless, thanks to the five blades that effortlessly glide over your skin. The razor even has a FlexDisc technology which adapts to the contours of your face, ensuring a comfortable and close shave every time.The only downside is that my wife keeps trying to steal it for herself! I guess it's not just for men after all.The Bugatti Limited Edition Shave Kit comes with everything you need for the perfect shave, including a magnetic charging dock, a travel case, and even a premium shaving cream. It's the ultimate shaving kit for the man who wants to look and feel his best.Overall, I would highly recommend the Gillette Heated Razor for Men, Bugatti Limited Edition Shave Kit by GilletteLabs to any man (or woman!) who wants to elevate their shaving experience to the next level. It's like having a spa day in your own bathroom, and who doesn't want that?",

I was hesitant to try this razor but not at that exorbitant price of $200+! I waited til it came down to $112,(although it\u2019s probably worth no more than $50 tops.) I will say it\u2019s really easy to use, charge, and switch temperatures on the blade.I used it for the first time in my shower, with shave cream, and got a really nice, smooth shave with zero irritation. The warm blade felt nice against the skin. Now, I\u2019ve read plenty of comments of \u201cwhy not just run your razor under hot water instead?\u201d Go ahead, and you\u2019ll have to do that over and over again! It\u2019s not going to continuously give the same feeling as the heated bar below the razor.Now, am I looking forward to paying a premium for replacement blades, no. Here\u2019s the thing though, I can stretch the life span out because I have different razors, and a few electric ones. I like to switch it up from time to time lol!Bottom line is it\u2019s not as bad as all the whiny reviews I\u2019ve read, but it\u2019s not for everyone either. It would be better priced around $50, but so far I do like it. You be the judge.Update: I\u2019m one month into using this razor now, 6 or 7 shaves all in the shower. Before I had to thoroughly wet my face with hot water to keep from the razor tugging my hair as I shave, but not with this razor. As soon as I apply shave cream and turn the heating element on, I\u2019m shaving tug free within 3-4 seconds. The heating element feels nice against the skin, and I really do get a nice, smooth shave. The top blue strip on the razor blade is starting to wear away some, but I\u2019m still getting a good shave from the initial blade.Will update again if things change.UPDATE 2:Razor handle quit charging on 4-18, not even 6 months into using it.I contacted Gillette via the chat feature on their webpage, had to provide proof of purchase through Amazon, and a few days later received a new kit in the mail.The short life of the charging handle does worry me some, but at least Gillette stood behind their product, and gave me a hassle free replacement.Will update again if need be.",

I read about the Gillette Labs razor and heard how good it was, and then stumbled across the heated razor I could get as well.  It was expensive, but I waited and before Black Friday it went on sale with a big price drop.  Even so, it was about six times more expensive than the ordinary Gillette razors.I usually shave in the shower using women's shave oil, which you can find online or in a big box store (the women's oils have many different smells and the bottle is significantly bigger than the oil drops I used to use).  I wait until I have been in there a bit and my face warms up, and then the shave is smooth and easy.  This razor claims to heat your face like they do when you get a barbershop shave, but they say a lot.  I started working out and wanted to shave, but not shower at home until after my workout, which meant shaving with a cold face, and trying to warm up the blade in a sink of hot water.I used this new razor this morning.  It was set to the hottest setting and holy buckets, the shave was amazingly comfortable.  It heats in less than one second and it gets warm.  It really does feel like a hot towel barber shave and I thought I got just as good a shave, if not better because it felt luxurious, than the other Gillette I use in the shower.  It is amazing.  This razor was well worth the money I spent on it.  The only down-side is that I probably wont be able to buy the blade refills at my local big box membership store.  Alas.",

When I opened the box and looked at the Bugatti, I thought that it would nick my face like crazy. Anyway I lathered up and began shaving. Oh boy!

Previously, he only used regular razors, explaining that electric shavers didn't provide a close enough cut. But from his first use of this heated razor, he was incredibly impressed. He mentioned how the warmth felt like a hot towel, with the heat emanating from the handle rather than the blade. He's also very pleased with the closeness of the shave it provides. This razor has positively transformed his daily routine, making it an enjoyable experience.",

I was hesitant to try this razor but not at that exorbitant price of $200+! I waited til it came down to $112,(although it\u2019s probably worth no more than $50 tops.) I will say it\u2019s really easy to use, charge, and switch temperatures on the blade.I used it for the first time in my shower, with shave cream, and got a really nice, smooth shave with zero irritation. The warm blade felt nice against the skin. Now, I\u2019ve read plenty of comments of \u201cwhy not just run your razor under hot water instead?\u201d Go ahead, and you\u2019ll have to do that over and over again! It\u2019s not going to continuously give the same feeling as the heated bar below the razor.Now, am I looking forward to paying a premium for replacement blades, no. Here\u2019s the thing though, I can stretch the life span out because I have different razors, and a few electric ones. I like to switch it up from time to time lol!Bottom line is it\u2019s not as bad as all the whiny reviews I\u2019ve read, but it\u2019s not for everyone either. It would be better priced around $50, but so far I do like it. You be the judge.Update: I\u2019m one month into using this razor now, 6 or 7 shaves all in the shower. Before I had to thoroughly wet my face with hot water to keep from the razor tugging my hair as I shave, but not with this razor. As soon as I apply shave cream and turn the heating element on, I\u2019m shaving tug free within 3-4 seconds. The heating element feels nice against the skin, and I really do get a nice, smooth shave. The top blue strip on the razor blade is starting to wear away some, but I\u2019m still getting a good shave from the initial blade.Will update again if things change.UPDATE 2:Razor handle quit charging on 4-18, not even 6 months into using it.I contacted Gillette via the chat feature on their webpage, had to provide proof of purchase through Amazon, and a few days later received a new kit in the mail.The short life of the charging handle does worry me some, but at least Gillette stood behind their product, and gave me a hassle free replacement.Will update again if need be.",

I am semi retired and usually shave every other day but It was 4 days since my last shave, with more stubble so I was a little hesitant about it's ability. I lathered up and used the razor. I have used many razors in my time, actually spending more on certain brands than this one, but I have to tell you, this was the most comfortable, accurate, smooth shave that I have ever had. I was astonished and greatly impressed. The razor cut through my 4 day beard like butter. The absolute closest, comfortable and easiest shave I have ever had. The price may be a little high for some but to get an excellent comfortable shave is worth every penny. Refills are a little pricey but if I can get 10 shaves with each blade, this is a home run for me. I would have liked a little hotter heat strip but that's just me.  THIS IS A WINNER IN MY BOOK !",

Let me tell you, this thing is a game changer!First of all, the heated razor feels like a hot towel is being draped over your face, making for a luxurious shaving experience. It's like a spa day in your own bathroom! The razor is designed with the same attention to detail as a Bugatti car, and I feel like I'm driving a luxury vehicle on my face.The shave itself is smooth and effortless, thanks to the five blades that effortlessly glide over your skin. The razor even has a FlexDisc technology which adapts to the contours of your face, ensuring a comfortable and close shave every time.The only downside is that my wife keeps trying to steal it for herself! I guess it's not just for men after all.The Bugatti Limited Edition Shave Kit comes with everything you need for the perfect shave, including a magnetic charging dock, a travel case, and even a premium shaving cream. It's the ultimate shaving kit for the man who wants to look and feel his best.Overall, I would highly recommend the Gillette Heated Razor for Men, Bugatti Limited Edition Shave Kit by GilletteLabs to any man (or woman!) who wants to elevate their shaving experience to the next level.

They drop down a little in sharpness but then seem to stay at that level for months so you can either change them every week or two to three times per year.  Now the problem.  I've had 4 of these.  With daily use the battery fails after 13 or 14 months.  Gillette will not offer an exchange or sell you just the razor without the expensive packaging and charger.  They may offer a slight discount but it's the same as their occasional sale price.  This applies to both the Bugatti edition and the regular.  No one appears to have figured out how to open the handle to change the battery.  I have 3 failed units.  I tried heat and solvent to open the first one with no luck.  Next I'm going to try to saw one open.Gillette needs to either fix their charge circuit that is destroying the battery or offer to exchange the razor at some reasonable cost, maybe $45 after the 12 month warranty.",

You want the hairs on your face to be soft and heated and use a cold blade. For example, when sharpening my chef knife, I use cold water on my whetstone so the molecules contract in the stone and become stronger while I put my chef knife under extremely hot water. Once the blade is sharp, I run the chef knife under cold water for a sharper blade. Heating the blade itself will make the blade less sharp. If you want a close shave, use a heated towel on your face, shaving cream, and a very cold blade for the best results. I feel like Gillette should know these basic concepts to the art of shaving.",

With daily use the battery fails after 13 or 14 months.  Gillette will not offer an exchange or sell you just the razor without the expensive packaging and charger.  They may offer a slight discount but it's the same as their occasional sale price.  This applies to both the Bugatti edition and the regular.  No one appears to have figured out how to open the handle to change the battery.  I have 3 failed units.  I tried heat and solvent to open the first one with no luck.  Next I'm going to try to saw one open.Gillette needs to either fix their charge circuit that is destroying the battery or offer to exchange the razor at some reasonable cost, maybe $45 after the 12 month warranty.",

Can not see any improvement. The shave though is good with a new blade replacement however for some reason these blades don't last long as the older 5 blade systems.BTW, replacing/attaching a new blade attachment is difficult to find the correct angle to attach to the handle even though I've tried over several months when required.

Much to my disappointment this device had the same problem after 10 months, again within the warranty of the replacement device.Gillette was very kind to again immediately send a replacement. Regrettably, this replacement device\u2019s battery was \u201cdead on arrival\u201d. I was requested to send the defect devices to the Gillette Repair center. Supposedly to verify that the devices were indeed defect. I received again new device in August 2023. But today, December 15 2023, the razor failed again after only 5 months.So that were 4 defect devices in two years. Obviously, Gillette has some serious quality problems. Please don\u2019t buy this product, you will be very disappointed.",

You want the hairs on your face to be soft and heated and use a cold blade. For example, when sharpening my chef knife, I use cold water on my whetstone so the molecules contract in the stone and become stronger while I put my chef knife under extremely hot water. Once the blade is sharp, I run the chef knife under cold water for a sharper blade. Heating the blade itself will make the blade less sharp. If you want a close shave, use a heated towel on your face, shaving cream, and a very cold blade for the best results. I feel like Gillette should know these basic concepts to the art of shaving.",
