It is a great book, I can recommend it, but it is not one of those books you can read without having access to the program it writes about. You want to get your hands dirty.let me explain:I read the first chapter explaining the ribbon interface and it does a great job doing this. It is well written and it gave a good first overview of the new working method. It does this by a good writing style accompanied with illustrations.Then I got on the second chapter explaining the capabilities of Excel. Because this is great for beginners I give it a thumbs up. More experienced users like myself will not read and use all the practice tests in the book but I have caught myself taking the book from the shelf from time to time for \\\"a quick reference in how to get things quickly done\\\".The book is called Excel 2007 a pocket guide with the tagline: a quick reference to common tasks.And the book delivers what it promises!\",\n",

Noteworthy is the initial section, with 11 (eleven) WWII original color pictures, most from the famous Jeff Ethell's private collection. A small introduction summarizes the facts from the birth of Luftwaffe to the end of 1942 (the remaining story is told in the volume 6, \\\" Defeat in the West, 1943-1945, from Mike Spick). The pictures, most in close-ups, are an excellent reference for modelers.
